This project demonstrates spam email classification using various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The dataset contains email messages labeled as spam or not spam. We preprocess the text data by vectorizing it into numerical form using CountVectorizer, followed by training and evaluating the models. The performance of the models is measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Cohen's kappa score. Additionally, visualizations are generated to compare the performance of these models on the test data.
